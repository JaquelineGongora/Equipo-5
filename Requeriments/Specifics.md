Specific Skills
During this second phase, we learned how to use new tools to carry out the project. Initially, we acquired the basic principles of databases, a field of which we had no prior knowledge, making it challenging to connect our database to the project. To achieve this, we had to use a new Integrated Development Environment (IDE) where we learned how to integrate new libraries through Maven. Thanks to the use of this new IDE, we mastered the creation of functional graphical interfaces for the program in a straightforward manner.

For the database, we also used the basics of SQL in MySQL Workbench to create our tables and link them to the IDE. We attempted to use databases through Google Cloud, and although we were able to connect everything properly, we ultimately decided not to use it. We believe that during this second phase, we gained new knowledge that, while basic, can be very useful for our future professional endeavors. We are impressed by the variety of tools available to create a database, as they proved somewhat complex to implement.
