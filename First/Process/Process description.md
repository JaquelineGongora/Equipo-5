We as a team chose to implement the agile SCRUM methodology, by
Having this methodology a high flexibility we can define
the tasks of each of the team members.
We organize sprints at least 3 times a week where we try to touch
the progress points of the project and if anyone has a question it is addressed immediately
and it is about solving.
Being a team of 5 people, we define the roles as follows:

SCRUM MASTER: Jaqueline Góngora.
The Scrum Master is responsible for managing and ensuring that the Scrum process is
is carried out correctly, as well as facilitating the execution of the process and its mechanics.

Product Owner: Mariana González.
Is the responsible for the project's outcome. The product owner seeks to maximize a product's value by
managing and optimizing the product backlog. 

Development team: Ricardo Cervera, Mauro Esquivel & Eduardo Gonzalez.
They are in charge of developing the product, self-organizing and self-managing to
manage to deliver an increment of software at the end of the development cycle.
