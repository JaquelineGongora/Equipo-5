As a team we identified the requirements of a system that we wanted to develop, we analyzed the points that this must 
cover based on the problem that we identify, we define metrics of the design of software as 
well as the development methodology that we were going to implement, therefore we have:

-Ability to develop, maintain and evaluate software services and systems that satisfy all 
requirements user and behave reliably and efficiently, are affordable 
to develop and maintain, and comply quality standards, applying the theories, 
principles, methods and practices of Software Engineering.

-Ability to assess customer needs and specify software requirements to satisfy
these needs, reconciling conflicting objectives by seeking compromises
acceptable within the limitations derived from cost, time, the existence of
already developed systems and the organizations themselves.

-Ability to provide solutions to integration problems based on available strategies, 
standards and technologies.

-Ability to identify and analyze problems and design, develop, implement, verify and 
document software solutions based on adequate knowledge of theories, models and current techniques.

-Ability to handle software modeling and design tools that allow the construction,
operation and maintenance of software applications in a systematic, measurable and rigorous manner.

-Ability to select and use development methodologies and implementation technologies more appropriate 
to customer requirements.
