Generic Competencies:

1. **Collaboration and Teamwork:**
   - We have strengthened our teamwork skills by dividing into two groups to address different aspects of the project. Effective collaboration has been essential to achieve synergy between abstraction, documentation, and coding.

2. **Effective Communication:**
   - The evolution of the project has required clear and effective communication among team members. From reviewing and modifying requirements to implementing changes, we have developed the ability to express ideas in a comprehensible and receptive manner.

3. **Adaptability and Flexibility:**
   - We have faced significant changes in the project's vision, showcasing our ability to adapt to new ideas and adjust our approach as needed. Flexibility has been crucial to modifying requirements, classes, and the project diagram.

4. **Problem Solving:**
   - Learning to code and working with a local database has improved our skills in addressing technical challenges. Problem-solving has been vital in overcoming obstacles in implementing the graphical interface and connecting to the database.

5. **Continuous Learning:**
   - The transition from the initial idea to implementation has required us to acquire new skills, such as creating local databases and programming in Java with the NetBeans IDE. Willingness to learn continuously has been essential for project progress.

6. **Planning and Organization:**
   - The team's division into specific tasks, with one half dedicated to abstraction and documentation, and the other to coding, reflects our ability to plan and organize work efficiently. This structure has allowed us to progress systematically toward our goals.

7. **Innovation and Creativity:**
   - The project's evolution has challenged us to think innovatively and creatively. The proposal to provide the program directly to the instructor with loaded diplomas and courses demonstrates our ability to find original solutions.

8. **Commitment to Project Objectives:**
   - We maintain a strong commitment to the project's objectives, as evidenced by the progress made so far. The determination to carry out coding and necessary documentation reflects our commitment to the project's ultimate success.
