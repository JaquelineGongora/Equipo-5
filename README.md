## Problem:
The instructors of "Educación continua" don´t have a website where they can register and edit their students' grades.

## Solution:
Web platform where instructors of courses and diplomas from the Faculty of Mathematics will be able to register, edit, and review the grades of previously enrolled students to facilitate the storage of the students' Continuing Education grade information.

## Objective:
Create a platform for "Educación Continua" that allows for the registration, modification, and review of student grades.

## Value Proposition:
To have the grades of students in diploma programs and courses from "Facultad de matemáticas" available on a web platform, where instructors can register and edit the students' grades.

## What is Continuing Education?
Diploma programs are part of the "Educación Continua" Program of the Department of Engagement at the "Facultad de matemátoicas", which promotes services demanded by society, various business and commercial stakeholders, the educational sector, and the government, by offering high-quality professional products and services.
The "Facultad de matemáticas", in accordance with its mission to "train highly qualified professionals, conduct research, and engage in outreach activities in mathematics and computer science, as well as their various applications," and in its commitment to meeting the needs in its area of expertise, offers the following to society:

## Product
Use cases were made with their diagram to have a better view of how it works.
With this we make modifications to the class diagram to turn it into a more accurate representation of what was mentioned above. When doing this we realized that it was essential to have a database where the information is stored, so an investigation was carried out. Once the class diagram was modified and with the information from the database, work began on the final version of the code for this delivery, which includes a connection to a local database, a code in which it is possible to assign and edit grades and a basic interface.
