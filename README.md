## ✏️  Problem:
The instructors of "Educación continua" don´t have a website where they can register and edit their students' grades.

## ✏️  Solution:
Web platform where instructors of courses and diplomas from the Faculty of Mathematics will be able to register, edit, and review the grades of previously enrolled students to facilitate the storage of the students' Continuing Education grade information.

## ✏️  Objective:
Create a platform for "Educación Continua" that allows for the registration, modification, and review of student grades.

# 📘 Description:
Our main project objective is to have the functionality to record and edit student grades, as well as previously registered courses and diplomas. However, it also allows access through a user and password that has been generated in advance. It also features two views: one for instructors and another for students. Within the instructor interface, there is access to a table where students data and grades will be recorded. It also enables direct editing from this interface, and once the changes are saved, there is an option to generate a PDF report. On the other hand, in the student interface, there is the option to generate personalized constancies containing the name, registration number, and the associated course. Finally, a functionality that the system will provide for both types of users is the ability to search for data using the student's registration number.

It is important to highlight the most relevant exceptions of the project, as it will not grant access to users not registered in the database. Additionally, when instructors input grades, the system will not allow negative numbers or values greater than 100.

## 📖 Value Proposition:
To have the grades of students in diploma programs and courses from "Facultad de matemáticas" available on a web platform, where instructors can register and edit the students' grades.

## 📖 What is Continuing Education?
Diploma programs are part of the "Educación Continua" Program of the Department of Engagement at the "Facultad de matemátoicas", which promotes services demanded by society, various business and commercial stakeholders, the educational sector, and the government, by offering high-quality professional products and services.
The "Facultad de matemáticas", in accordance with its mission to "train highly qualified professionals, conduct research, and engage in outreach activities in mathematics and computer science, as well as their various applications," and in its commitment to meeting the needs in its area of expertise, offers the following to society:
