## Problem:
The instructors of "Educación continua" don´t have a website where they can register and edit their students' grades.

## Solution:
Web platform where instructors of courses and diplomas from the Faculty of Mathematics will be able to register, edit, and review the grades of previously enrolled students to facilitate the storage of the students' Continuing Education grade information.

## Objective:
Create a platform for "Educación Continua" that allows for the registration, modification, and review of student grades.

## Value Proposition:
To have the grades of students in diploma programs and courses from "Facultad de matemáticas" available on a web platform, where instructors can register and edit the students' grades.

## What is Continuing Education?
Diploma programs are part of the "Educación Continua" Program of the Department of Engagement at the "Facultad de matemátoicas", which promotes services demanded by society, various business and commercial stakeholders, the educational sector, and the government, by offering high-quality professional products and services.
The "Facultad de matemáticas", in accordance with its mission to "train highly qualified professionals, conduct research, and engage in outreach activities in mathematics and computer science, as well as their various applications," and in its commitment to meeting the needs in its area of expertise, offers the following to society:

## Product Evolution
The goal of our project is to create a web application for Continuous Education teachers or instructors to Register and Modify grades of previously registered students. The idea is to scale the project until it becomes fully functional.
We made significant progress from the initial phase, where we had many ideas about what needed to be done, and each team member had a different vision. As a result, things like requirements, classes, and their diagram have been modified.
Initially, we thought both teachers and students could review grades, but that would require two different types of credentials. The current idea is to provide the program directly to the instructor with the loaded diplomas and courses. After making these changes, we started coding. To do this, we had to learn how to create a local database and plan to move it to the cloud by the end of the project. We have started working on the graphical interface, although it is still subject to possible changes to look better and function seamlessly with the MVC paradigm.
