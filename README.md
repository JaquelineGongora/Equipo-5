## Problem:
The instructors of "Educaci칩n continua" don췂t have a website where they can register and edit their students' grades.

## Solution:
Web platform where instructors of courses and diplomas from the Faculty of Mathematics will be able to register, edit, and review the grades of previously enrolled students to facilitate the storage of the students' Continuing Education grade information.

## Objective:
Create a platform for "Educaci칩n Continua" that allows for the registration, modification, and review of student grades.

## Project
This project makes it possible:
- Changes were made to the graphical interfaces: the module's status (approved or failed) and the overall diploma status were identified.
- The "display table" option was implemented, allowing the instructor to view previously registered student data.
- The function of editing grades from the table was added.
- Generation and download of the previous table via a PDF were incorporated.
- Generation and download of certificates were added for students who have completed and passed a module, diploma, or course.
- A graphical interface was added where students can view their grades by entering their registration numbers and selecting the course, diploma, or module they attended.
The project follows the MVC paradigm, featuring models like "Estudiante" (Student) and "Usuario" (User), along with controllers dedicated to actions such as search and modification. The graphical interfaces, or views, range from login to PDF report generation. Each component plays a distinct role, offering specific functionalities for instructors and students. The interfaces are designed for an efficient and well-structured user experience, addressing the unique needs of each user type in an organized manner.

## Value Proposition:
To have the grades of students in diploma programs and courses from "Facultad de matem치ticas" available on a web platform, where instructors can register and edit the students' grades.

## What is Continuing Education?
Diploma programs are part of the "Educaci칩n Continua" Program of the Department of Engagement at the "Facultad de matem치toicas", which promotes services demanded by society, various business and commercial stakeholders, the educational sector, and the government, by offering high-quality professional products and services.
The "Facultad de matem치ticas", in accordance with its mission to "train highly qualified professionals, conduct research, and engage in outreach activities in mathematics and computer science, as well as their various applications," and in its commitment to meeting the needs in its area of expertise, offers the following to society:
