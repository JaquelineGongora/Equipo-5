# Constructive Critique


At first, we want to say that we learned a lot of new things during this course. Before starting this semester, we didn't know how to create graphical interfaces, work with databases, MVC pattern, etc. We liked the fact that we are learning things that we are supposed to learn in future semesters, and we enjoyed the classes and discussions with classmates from advanced classes or those who have already graduated.

We have a problem with this course, but we acknowledge that we are part of this problem too. It has been mentioned that this course is based on a lot of self-study to practice and apply the things learned in the classroom. Personally, we haven't developed that ability, and we know that we have to improve, but it caused us some difficulties this semester.

We propose to identify activities (not exams) where we have a problem and have to use abstraction, and then solve it with code. In our opinion, there were some instructions that were not entirely clear during the course, especially in exams. Another complication that we had was the use of GitHub. Honestly, we think it's good that we have to learn these useful tools, but again, we have to figure out how to use them.

In conclusion, we learned a lot of new things this semester. We are grateful for the knowledge gained. We believe that this kind of learning may not be our strong suit, but we know we have to improve that skill. Currently, it was challenging for us.
