Prioritization of requirements:

Functional requirements:

•	FR1: This is considered the highest-priority requirement because the project is based on recording grades for students.

•	FR2: This requirement is important as the editing of grades is one of the foundations of the project.

•	FR3: This requirement combines the two preceding ones, making it relevant for consolidating information.

•	FR4: Since the project's goal is to record grades, it is valuable for the students themselves to be able to visualize them.

•	FR5: Despite this requirement allowing the user to access the platform, it is not considered high priority as it is not part of the main project objective.

•	FR6: This requirement is of low priority as it also does not form part of the project's objectives but is considered somewhat useful.

•	FR7: It is the last requirement as it is not part of the project's objectives and is something that can be generated manually, but it facilitates the process.
