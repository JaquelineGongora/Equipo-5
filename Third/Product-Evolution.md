# Product Evolution:
At the project's outset, the main idea was to create a web platform through which instructors of Educación Continua diploma and course programs at the Facultad de Matemáticas could register, modify, and view their students' grades. This platform would have a sole user category: the instructors of these diploma and course programs.

During the second delivery, work focused on the documentation established since the first delivery, with the only relevant implementation being the code. This involved setting up a CRUD with a simple graphical interface connected to a local database.

For the third delivery, the project underwent several changes. Among the most relevant are:
1.	Changes were made to the graphical interfaces: the module's status (approved or failed) and the overall diploma status were identified.
2.	The "display table" option was implemented, allowing the instructor to view previously registered student data.
3.	The function of editing grades from the table was added.
4.	Generation and download of the previous table via a PDF were incorporated.
5.	Generation and download of certificates were added for students who have completed and passed a module, diploma, or course.
6.	A graphical interface was added where students can view their grades by entering their registration numbers and selecting the course, diploma, or module they attended.
